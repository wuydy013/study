    <h1>The ACTIVate Study</h1>
    <p>The ACTIVate study is a collaborative project between the University of South Australia and the University of Newcastle. It aims to investigate the intricate relationship between lifestyle patterns, cognitive function, and brain health among older adults. The research project is a 3-year prospective longitudinal cohort study with 448 participants aged 60-70 across Adelaide and Newcastle, Australia. ACTIVate is the first to investigate the impact of time use and diet compositions on thinking ability and brain function. By uncovering these associations, the study seeks to pave the way for innovative multidomain interventions tailored to address the interplay between activity and diet behaviours, offering new dementia prevention strategies. Ultimately, the insights from ACTIVate will empower individuals to craft personalised regimens optimised for cognitive well-being, contributing to the global endeavour of dementia prevention.</p>
